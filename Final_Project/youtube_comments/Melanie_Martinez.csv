I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space

And when you're out there, without care
Yeah I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And now that you are having the time of your life
Well think twice
That's my only advice

Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you
Who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?
Well

I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart
To lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember, is thinking
I wanna be like them
Mm hmm ever since I was little
Ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy

(originally by Gnarls Barkley)

I remember when‚Äî
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo in so much space

And when you're out there
Without care,
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice.
That's my only advice

Come on now.
Who do you, who do you, who do you‚Äî
Who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control

Well, I think you're crazy,
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy.
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking I wanna be like them

Ever since I was little,
Ever since I was little it looked like fun
But it was no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy,
But maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy.
Probably

Probably
Just like me
Just like me
Just like me",0,false,0,,,,,,
