The thing is, she was hitting the notes fine at the end, she absolutely has the range. This is just nerves and/or not being able to hear herself well enough. The backchannel feedback from most singers who've been on the voice has been that the in-ear monitoring takes getting used to and most on the show have never used them before. That, and they don't really have the time to get used to it before they have to perform. That's why you'll see them pulling a monitor out of their ear, it's so they can hear what the crowd mix sounds like because that's what they're used to. 

This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when monitoring is weird and you're nervous.",0

 She was flat and hunting for the big note during the chorus.
