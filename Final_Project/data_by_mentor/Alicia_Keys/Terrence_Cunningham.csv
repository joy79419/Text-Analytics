Terrence is an awesome musician and I will miss him a lot. He did amazing every week and I love it when he didn't take risks. He just needs to use his falsetto more often and he should keep playing piano more often. When he sings it's like meditation kind of music where he is the kind of singer who wants to heal peoples  hearts. He heals my heart and calms me down a lot. But that kind of music is not for The Voice. It's better off for an album instead. I can't wait for him to work on his album as I will buy it. Alicia has the best team ever.

He has pigeonholed himself as an artist making himself a one trick pony that sings the same way every time using the same instrument every time, his performances are the same, his song choices are the same every time. He is unwilling to step out of his comfort zone and show the audience that he has other talents and skills then what he is doing. No one wants to go to a show where the artist is going to do a show singing for an hour the same type of songs the whole way through or buy an album that consists of the same type of songs throughout the entire album. It has nothing to do with tempo either but the type of songs he chosen all being the same in style and genre. All the other artists on the show especially team Blake tonight showed that they are able to not only sing out of their comfort zone or sing songs out of their comfort zone. Choosing a song that the audience would never expect from them. When you are in a competition with 24 people fighting to make ornaments to the top 12 you have to make yourself stand out from the pack not stand back and in essence blend into the crowd as to make yourself completely forgettable once the night is over and everyone has sung but the audience can’t even remember that you were one of the contestants that sang. 
Don’t know if Terrence himself is relying on the fact that he knows he is Alicia’s favorite and will automatically move him forward to the top 12 in her team even though tonight on Twitter he came in 3rd on the votes with Jackie and Christiana getting the most votes. Jackie will end up winning the most votes leaving Terrence, Christiana, Johnny and Kelsea. Out of those that are left it should be either Kelsea or Christiana that gets to move forward especially Kelsea who has a very original sounding voice and is able to sing different genres of music just like Christiana. They both taken risks and stepped out of their comfort zones throughout the competition whereas with Terrence his performances have been the same each and every time he performs.",2
