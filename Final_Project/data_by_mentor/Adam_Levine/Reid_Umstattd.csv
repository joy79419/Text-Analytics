I've been watching the Voice since Season 1 and  though there have some really great performances from many people, I hadn't thought anyone, except We'  McDonald had the ""Voice"" until I saw Reid's performance !!! Still upset with Adam and haven't watched another episode of the voice this season! üò†üò† I sure hope Reid proves them wrong, either solo or with his previous band ""nelo"".  I am hooked on their music now and cant believe they never made it big and famous, because their recordings, especially live, are f$&@ing fantastic.  I hope they get a good manager that will promote them like they should have been 4-5 years ago. I hope they rerelease their live album in Studio when they do!!!
