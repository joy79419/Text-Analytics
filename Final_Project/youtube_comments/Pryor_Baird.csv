I personally like this genre of music. He is awesome. 9 to 5 was not a good song choice for him but he is rocking it and having a good time. He appears relaxed and is comfortable in front of an audience. He is long overdue his opportunity in the business. In my opinion he will get a record deal with or without the voice.

If he has Kyla, Wilkes and then Spensha with Kyla and Wilkes being his best opportunities to win this season but more so with Wilkes. He can sing any genre and has the ability to project emotion with his performances. Kyla has an amazing voice but the problem is America never ends up voting for women or men that have that style of voice after a few weeks they get tired of the same Diva like songs which are from the 90s and not what we listen to in today’s music on the radio. Wilkes on the other hand has the ability to come out with music that could allow him to produce music from many different genres but have a home in country music and once you find a home in country music and the fans of country music embraces you, you have a home for life and a chance for stardom unlike many of the other genres in the music industry today. Country music is the one genre where fans still support and buy their favorite artists actual CDs and not just download their music, they go to festivals and concerts year round. Which is why Cassadee Pope, Danielle Bradberry, Raelynn and other country artists that have been on the show have made it compared to other winners of the show or contestants that were quite popular. Only a few of them have been able to make it but almost all of the country singers have because that’s the one genre of music that is part of America that isn’t really mainstream and is looked down on unless you yourself are a part of that same America, fly over country. Granted because of the Voice and Blake there has been more acceptance of country music and popularization of country music but it’s still the one genre that mainstream America looks down upon and has many prejudices against. Which is probably why it has been able to maintain while the other genres haven’t unless you are a huge star in that genre already but those artists only make money on their concerts and very little off of actual music sales because of streaming and people downloading the music for free instead of buying the album. Most people will only buy a few of the songs not the entire album which makes it difficult for new artists to come out and make it within the music industry and have more than one hit or be very underrated in the industry. Okay I went way off topic so I’m just going to say that this season it’s going to be Wilkes, Brynn, Britton and Kelsea or Kaleb as the top 4. Brynn already is the front runner this season but Wilkes has the opportunity very quickly to gain popularity enough to become the front runner and make it so that it’s between the two of them as the final two contestants.",2
