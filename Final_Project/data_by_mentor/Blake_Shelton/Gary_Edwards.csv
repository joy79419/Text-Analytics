It turns out that it‚Äôs a joint decision. If it were only up to the singers, they‚Äôd all pick the same songs, says executive producer Audrey Morrissey.

What happens is that the contender gives the producers a list of the songs he would like to perform.

‚ÄúWe have several recordings of (the contestants). We‚Äôve seen them in person. We listen to them again. We cross reference with their list. Then we think, ‚ÄòOK, what is the right song for them to get a push?‚Äô That‚Äôs all we‚Äôre thinking about,‚Äù says Morrissey.

‚ÄúWhat song do we feel they can handle? ‚Ä¶ Often times artistes are not clear on what kind of artiste they want to be. Sometimes they‚Äôre just putting songs on their list that they love and they‚Äôre not really thinking about their personal statement.

‚ÄúI can tell you this: regardless of what people may say at the moment, there is no person that goes on that stage that the song that they ultimately perform and end up with isn‚Äôt a song that derived from their list, or was inspired by their list. ‚ÄúOr that they did not raise their hand and say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt feel good about this.‚Äô At any point they can, and their song will be changed.‚Äù ‚Äì Tribune News Service

Not one country in Europe, Canada, Asia, South America or African country. They on the other hand don‚Äôt have granteeed rights for their citizens and in many of these countries especially in today‚Äôs western countries like in Europe they are taking away rights from their people every day. Yet in America we are granteeed our rights and no matter who is our president or in charge of congress those rights can‚Äôt be taken away from us, especially not without major approval of the American population wanting that change to happen to the constitution which hasn‚Äôt happened since the changes during the civil rights era. No one seems to even understand how‚Äôs lucky they are to be living in America or even in this time. How far we have come in today‚Äôs society, technological advancements, medical advancements, etc to have the lives we all have. Just because we might have struggles in our daily lives due to finances, education or even personal problems that doesn‚Äôt mean that America as a country isn‚Äôt the best country in the world and that we are beyond lucky as Americans to have been born in America in‚Äôs of any other country in the world. Which isn‚Äôt why so many risk their lives for this country daily and why thousands each year risk their lives to come to this country illegally. If their home countries were better countries then America they wouldn‚Äôt be fighting to get to come here or fighting so hard to remain in the US once they get here Illegally. Why they want to have citizenship and have the same rights as every other American citizen has.
This is why our education system needs to be reformed. No one is truly being taught the history of this country and the rest of the world. They leave our so much of our history and the worlds that we have generations only learning the bad and never the good. They don‚Äôt learn the bad of other nations, cultures and what truly happened throughout history to understand how life was back then compared to today and how to take that knowledge as well to understand that you can‚Äôt compare what life was like back in the early 16th or 19th hundreds to compare that time to todas standards and label only the bad so as to cancel our everything anyone or country has done that was good. This is also why today we are so polarized as a country between the right and left. One side ones sees the bad while the other side takes everything into consideration, the good and the bad...the world isn‚Äôt black and white...there is a lot of gray in the world.",10
