Wilkes was really the only unique artist this season; a guy who could rearrange a song and give it a whole new life. He's also a songwriter. A real ""star' has to be able to make their own music.

He has a unique, subtle appearance unlike anyone in the comp. His i-tune downloads are keepers.
I'm sure he would've sung a Christian rock song, down the line, and it would land on top of the charts. Blake has a talented team. No need to dis the others--",5,false,0,,,,,,

Producers have to limit songs to 2 minutes for TV so the band adjusts the tempo in their headsets to the already shortened song to finish in 2 minutes.
