You only have to look at his YouTube performances to see that he gets almost as much dislikes as likes because he does the same thing week after week, never taking any risks or setting out of his comfort zone to show that he has any versatility or originality.Kelsea on the other hand takes risks and has a unique voice making her stand out from the competition. She might not have the power like Jackie but you don‚Äôt need be a powerhouse singer to be someone that the public will want to support and want to hear not just in the competition but afterwards when she starts making her own music and touring. She has a voice that can take her places in the music industry and give her her own lane that isn‚Äôt overcrowded with Diva singers. Which would allow her to become quite successful in today‚Äôs music industry. I for one love country music first and foremost but Kelsea has such a unique sounding voice that I for one would love to hear whatever she would record and sing, unlike other singers in the competition that isn‚Äôt country. Just hoping it‚Äôs Kelsea tomorrow night because out of all the performances of team Alicia tonight she was the one that stood out to me and shined the brightest. That‚Äôs why with the amount of talent this year and the changes to the rules it would be amazing that they would change it an make it a top 16 instead of 12 allowing for each team to have 4 artists make it to the live shows instead of just 3. That way it could be both Kelsea and Christiana. Christiana was also good but she struggled in her performance to me. Then based overrall on all their past performances Kelsea has stood out on team Alicia from the start compared to everyone else on the team. It was always. Britton, Kelsea and Christiana that I was hoping to make top 3 on Alicia‚Äôs Team but Jackie got the most votes tonight on Twitter so it‚Äôs going to have to be only one of them and I chose Kelsea!",5,false,0,,,,,,
