He makes sure that his artists don‚Äôt get pigeonholed into a stereotype and makes them push out of their comfort zones, take risks and sing songs and perform differently every time they get on stage. Whereas other coaches will have their artists sing the same types of songs over and over, perform the same way over and over, use the same instruments instead of forcing them to break out of their comfort zone or sing songs that the audience won‚Äôt expect from them so they don‚Äôt get bored or become lost among the rest of the artists in the competition, so that they stand out in front of the crowd. Granted for Team Blake already Kyla has been moved forward and tonight on twitter it was WILKES who for the most votes so Blake will then Ben choosing from Austin, Spensha, Pryor and Gary. Out of those three Spensha is Blake‚Äôs favorite and he will more than likely chose her to Ben his 3rd team member.
