Her attempts at pulling jazz modulations out of these melodies is sub par below sub par and is an insult to anyone w real jazz chops. Her breath control is so suspect and her quiver vibrato is horrible. Her pitch was like a drunk guy trying to hit the bullseye on a dart board. The reason Ms Keys feels this way is her ear is suspect as well. She will not make top 8 her voice is unique for sure but I would never want her ears as a singer. Its uniquely mediocre. She is not a world class vocalist. 5 more yrs of work at her craft and gigging then maybe. She is raw and my ear says uhn uhn.,0,false,0,,,,,,
