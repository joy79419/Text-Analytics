Yes it does suck, but it gives what everyone wished on the artists and what they wanted. This gave them more screen time, and more songs to perform. That is really why they entered the competition in the first place. To be able to get attention and get popular enough to eventually to get a record deal or to publish music.",2

Some artists just can’t anyone else do their songs justice that they end up sounding like they are doing karaoke. Plus songs from Mariah Carrey are just untouchable by anyone because no one can sing like Mariah. Then Whitney and even Beyoncé have had their songs done so much now that it’s tired and boring when they do sing them. Adele is an artist that is untouchable unless you do the song in a way that makes it totally different. The one person that could do that was James Arthur when he did One of Adele’s songs when he was on the X Factor. Everyone else who sings Adele does it to where they try to hard to sound like Adele making it sound like Karaoke. Carrie Underwood is also an artist that whenever people try to sing her songs they end up not doing well after they have done so because her songs are so difficult, just like Kelly Clarkson songs. Some Divas are just not meant to be sung on competition shows and should be left for the artists alone to sing.",3
