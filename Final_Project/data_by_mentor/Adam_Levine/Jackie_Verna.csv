Britton for Alicia should be top 8 but finale is uncertain. Jackie F is too similar to previous female rock style singers, she'll make the top 8 but that'll be it and Christiana should make top 8 but I doubt she'll make the finale. I think Spensha will make top 10, maybe top 9 or 8 but no further. Kyla will make top 8 but I doubt she'll see the finale because Pryor will get more votes since he's more of Blake's kind of artist.
