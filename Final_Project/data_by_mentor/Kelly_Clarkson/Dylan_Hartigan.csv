He had some good moments earlier this season, but why on earth did he choose to sing this song? It's a great song, but it's obviously not suited for his vocal style. He tries to make it his own, but it just fails miserably. Tom Petty was a Southern kid with country phrasing in his voice. Dylan is a typical Jersey kid who looks like an underwear model. I'm not surprised that he bombed tonight.",5

I was 11 years old when this song was released in 1993. It's iconic, and Dylan simply doesn't have the vocal style for this song. He tries to add some r&b slides and smoother vocal transitions (trust me, it's obvious if you listen to the Tom Petty original), because Dylan is a pop/r&b singer. Sometimes that can work but not with Tom Petty. It was a terrible song choice for him.",2

,,,,,,,,UgxlbD5jzHY4draN10t4AaABAg.8fCPx9Q2sAW8fCqUZavvHY,Abigail Kirschner,5 months ago,1526057337198,Btw he didn’t bomb...the vote was close between him and the guy who made it. He basically had to get the top vote out of five people. Getting the second most votes isn’t bombing. Kelly was gonna pic DR regardless,2

I really think he’s suited more for pop/rock then the genre he is trying to go for. Other than that yes he looks like a Calvin Klein model hopefully he takes that up. He’s definitely eye candy for the young ladies.,1
